    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    starting_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    current_price DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
    image_url VARCHAR(255),
    end_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

    item_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    bid_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY (item_id) REFERENCES items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    message VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
